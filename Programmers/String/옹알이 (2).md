```
function solution(babbling) {
    const speak = ["aya","ye","woo","ma"];
    let count=0;
    
    for(let i of babbling){
        
        for(j of speak){
            if(i.includes(j.repeat(2))){
                break;
            }
            i = i.split(j).join(" ")
        }
        if(i.split(" ").join("").length===0){
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

This is a problem that we need to trim all item that includes `speak` in` babbling`
However, the trick is that if the item is repeat twice time in a row, it should be not counted. 

For example, 
Lets say one item of `babbling` is "ayaywooe".
it will splice to "y woo e" => "y e" 

Basically, this approach to changes the array to a string and trim the `speak` item using `split()` . However, the trick is that if the last item is like example above, it will be passed if you use `join("")`. So, it would be better to use`join(" ")`  first and use `join("")` to check if all item has been  removed.
