# 로또의 최고 순위와 최저 순위

```
function solution(lottos, win_nums) {
    let countZero = 0;
    let result=0;
    let rank = {0:6, 1:6, 2:5, 3:4, 4:3, 5:2, 6:1}
    let test = lottos.forEach((i)=>{
        if(win_nums.includes(i)){
            result++
        }else{
            if(i===0) countZero++;
        }
        
    }); 
    return [rank[result+countZero],rank[result]];
}
```

1. Count items which is included in both `lottos` and `win_nums` using `forEach()`
2. Also, count the number of zero.
3. The number of match item becomes the low rank, and after adding  that number of Zero become the high rank.
### Time Complexity
O(n)
