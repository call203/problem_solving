```
function solution(n, m, section) {

	let count=0;
	let point=0; // painted area
	
	for(let i =0; i<section.length; i++){
		// if painted area is smaller than now point
		if(point <section[i]){
			point = section[i] + m -1;
			//paint! 
			count++;
		}
	}
	return count;
}
```

Both of them using two pointer. However, in accepted1, shift() is the one of slow function than push()/pop(), and time complexity is O(n^2). So Accepted2 is more ideal code.

### Time Complexity
1. O(n^2)
2. O(n)
