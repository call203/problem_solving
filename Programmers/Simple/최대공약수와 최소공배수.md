1. Greatest common divisor
	Euclidean Algoritm : If `r` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, then the common divisors of `a` and `b` are precisely the same as the common divisors of `b` and `r`. Therefore, by reducing the larger number with each iteration and replacing it with the remainder until one of the numbers becomes zero, the GCD can be correctly determined.
1. Least common multiple
   (n * m) / GCD
