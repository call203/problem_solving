function solution(brown, yellow) {
    let width = 0;
    let height = 0;

    for (let i = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(yellow)); i >= 1; i--) {
        if (yellow % i === 0) {
            height = i + 2;
            width = (yellow / i) + 2;
            if (width * height === brown + yellow) {
                return [width, height];
            }
        }
    }
    return [];
}
```

1. Find the combination with `width` and `height`.
   => height can be only between 1 to `sqrt(`yellow`)`
2. Check answer you found is same value as brown + yellow.
   **Note**
   This is important for the exceptional situation following as:
   -Yellow value is bigger than brown one.
   -There is no Yellow value.
