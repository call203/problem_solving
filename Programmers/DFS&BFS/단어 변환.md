```


**DFS Progress:**

1. Initial State

- Current word: `hit`
- Visited words: []
- Path: `hit`
- Depth: 0

2. First DFS Call

- Call `dfs("hit", 0)`
- Current word: `hit`
- `hit` is not `target`, so start exploring the next words.
- Visited words: [`hit`]

 3. Find Possible Transformations (from `hit`)

- `hit` → `hot` (1 letter difference)


 4. Second DFS Call

- Call `dfs("hot", 1)`
- Current word: `hot`
- `hot` is not `target`, so start exploring the next words.
- Visited words: [`hit`, `hot`]
- Path: `hit → hot`

5. Find Possible Transformations (from `hot`)

- `hot` → `dot` (1 letter difference)
- `hot` → `lot` (1 letter difference)

 6. Third DFS Call (exploring `dot`)

- Call `dfs("dot", 2)`
- Current word: `dot`
- `dot` is not `target`, so start exploring the next words.
- Visited words: [`hit`, `hot`, `dot`]
- Path: `hit → hot → dot`

7. Find Possible Transformations (from `dot`)

- `dot` → `dog` (1 letter difference)

 8. Fourth DFS Call (exploring `dog`)

- Call `dfs("dog", 3)`
- Current word: `dog`
- `dog` is not `target`, so start exploring the next words.
- Visited words: [`hit`, `hot`, `dot`, `dog`]
- Path: `hit → hot → dot → dog`

9. Find Possible Transformations (from `dog`)

- `dog` → `cog` (1 letter difference)

10. Fifth DFS Call (exploring `cog`)

- Call `dfs("cog", 4)`
- Current word: `cog`
- `cog` is the `target`, so the search ends.
- Visited words: [`hit`, `hot`, `dot`, `dog`, `cog`]
- Path: `hit → hot → dot → dog → cog`
