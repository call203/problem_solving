```
function solution(people, limit) {
    let count=0;

    people.sort((a,b)=>b-a)
    let l = 0;
    let r = people.length-1;

    while(l<=r){
        if(limit - (people[l] + people[r]) >=0 ){
            l++;
            r--;
         }else{
            l++;
         }
        count++;
    }

    return count
}
```

1. Sorting people in ascending order allow to consider the heaviest people first.
2. if the sum of the weights on the right and left sides exceeds the limit, move left side one step to reduce the total weight.
3. Otherwise, move both of them together.

### Time Complexity
O(n)
