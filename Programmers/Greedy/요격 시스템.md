function solution(targets) {
    targets.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    let answer = 1; 
    let lastEnd = targets[0][1]; 

    for (let i = 1; i < targets.length; i++) {
        const [start, end] = targets[i];
       
        if (start >= lastEnd) {
            answer++;
            lastEnd = end;

    }

This problem requires finding the minimum number of bombs based on `targets`. Therefore, it is necessary to use sorting and calculate the minimum routes with a greedy algorithm.

**Note** 
The standard of comparison between items should be the item `[_, a]` and item `[b, _]`."
