1. It is not possible to reduce count of changing the alphabet (up ▲ and down ▼).
2. The minimum result is determined by the cursor (left◀ and right▶).
3. The initial minimum value for The right as is   `name.length -1 `
4. We can skip the "A" alphabet and consider the count that move to the left side. 
5. The minimum value is determined by  the right and left side's count.
