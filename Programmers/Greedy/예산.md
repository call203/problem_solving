```
function solution(d, budget) {
    d.sort((a,b)=>a-b);
    
    let result = 0;
    let i =0
    for(let cost of d){
        let temp = budget-cost;
        if(temp<0) break;
        budget = temp;
        result++
    }
    
    
    return result
}
```

### Solution using `reduce()`
```
function solution(d, budget) {
    return d.sort((a, b) => a - b).reduce((count, price) => {
        return count + ((budget -= price) >= 0);
    }, 0);
}
```

The returned part calculate from  passing all element in array. So It is deal to use `reduce()`
Note that if the `buget-=price` is less than 0, it results in `False`, which is equivalent to 0. Therefore, the count will not increase anymore after that.

### Time Complexity
O(n)
