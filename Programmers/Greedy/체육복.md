If the student has lost their clothes, they can't borrow their's to others. 
For example, consider`n = 5`, `lost[2,3]`, `reserve = [3]` where student 3 is the case that is mentioned above. 
In this case, we can remove them using `filter()` in both `realLost` and `realReserve`
### Accepted
```
function solution(n, lost, reserve) {
     let realLost = lost.filter(l => !reserve.includes(l)).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let realReserve = reserve.filter(r => !lost.includes(r)).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let count = 0;
    for (let i of realLost) {
        let before = realReserve.indexOf(i - 1);
        let after = realReserve.indexOf(i + 1);
        
        if (before > -1) {
            count++;
            realReserve.splice(before, 1);
            continue
        }else if (after > -1){
            count++;
            realReserve.splice(after, 1);
        } 
      
    }
    
    return n - (realLost.length - count);
}

```
