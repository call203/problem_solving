function solution(bridge_length, weight, truck_weights) {

    let queue = [];
    let queueSum = 0;
    let sec = 0;

    while(truck_weights.length >0 || queue.length>0){
        sec++
        if(queue.length >0 && queue[0].time === sec){
            queueSum -=queue[0].weight;
            queue.shift()
        }

        //Add truck in queue
        if(queue.length < bridge_length && queueSum+truck_weights[0] <= weight){
            let truck = truck_weights.shift();
            queue.push({weight:truck, time: sec + bridge_length})
            queueSum+=truck
        }
    }

    return sec
}
```


**Note**
how can i know the each truck's time is over to get out of the bridge? For this reason, the time should be recorded with the truck in the queue using `{}`
1. The time should be processed every second in the loop.
2. Push the truck in the queue
	- The total queue weight must be less than the weight limit.
	- However, there is also a limitation on the number of trucks.
3. Shift the truck in the queue
	- If the time for the first item in the queue is over compared to the `sec`, remove the truck in the queue
