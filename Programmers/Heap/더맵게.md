***JavaScript does not support heap library.***

We need to find the smallest value of food and the second smallest value of food.
After calculate them, it need to insert proper location in the `min` heap


**Note**
You can think that `sort()` would be work for this.
But the problem is you should sort() whenever you insert the new node.
Additionally, sort() time complexity is O(nlogn)




### Time complexity
O(logn)
