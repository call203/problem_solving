1. **Extract the item from the ticket array if it is the right path**  Each flight ticket should be used exactly once in the correct order. For example, if a ticket `[from, to]` is used in the itinerary, it should be removed from the available tickets so that it cannot be reused.
   
2. **If the ticket array's length is 0, stop the recursive**
   This condition ensures that the recursion stops when all tickets have been used to form a complete itinerary. When there are no more tickets left to use (`tickets.length === 0`), the recursion should terminate.
